NAME
       xml2flat - flatten XML files by specifying some XPath expressions


SYNOPSIS
       xml2flat [OPTIONS] LOOPEXPRESSION COLUMNEXPRESSION...


DESCRIPTION
       xml2flat takes an XML document from a file or standard input, eval‐
       uates the XPath expression LOOPEXPRESSION  and  iterates  over  the
       resulting  nodelist.  For each node in this list each COLUMNEXPRES‐
       SION is evaluated (with the found node as context) and the  content
       of the first node addressed by COLUMNEXPRESSION is printed to stan‐
       dard output, delimited with TAB characters.


OPTIONS
       -f INPUTFILE
              read data from INPUTFILE instead of STDIN


       -d DELIMITER
              use DELIMITER instead of Tab as field delimiter when  print‐
              ing columns


       -n NAMESPACEPREFIX NAMESPACEURL
              register  namespace NAMESPACEURL as NAMESPACEPREFIX. Needed,
              if the document uses namespaces.


       -s     stop if column-node was not found. Usually, when a node  for
              some  column  is  not  found, an empty string is returned at
              this position. When specifying -s, xml2flat will  exit  with
              an error instead.


XPATH EXPRESSIONS
       xml2flat  uses libxml2 to parse the document and evaluate the LOOP‐
       EXPRESSION and COLUMNEXPRESSIONs. So these have to be  in  a  XPath
       syntax  that  libxml2  understands. You can find a nice tutorial on
       XPath here: http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/
